# The onClick event handler

The `onClick` callback of the `Item` component gives you access to an object with 2 properties, `event` and `props`.

- The `event` property refers to the native event which triggered the menu. It can be used to access the mouse coordinate or any other event prop.
- The `props` property will merge `data` passed to `Item` and `MenuProvider`.

## With MenuProvider

With the `MenuProvider` the `props` object will contains a `ref` property.
- If you wrap a single react component ref will be the mounted instance of the wrapped component.
- If you wrap more than one component ref will be an array containing a ref of every component.

## With contextMenu

With the `contextMenu` helper you do what you want!
