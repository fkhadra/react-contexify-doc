# Migrate from v3

- `ContextMenu` has been renamed to `Menu`
- `ContextMenuProvider` has been renamed to `MenuProvider`
- The `onClick` callback signature has been simplified. The `data` and the `ref` are merged to props.

```js
// Old signature
({ event, ref, data, dataFromProvider }) => void;

// New one
({ event, props }) => void;
```

- The `MenuProvider` is limited a new api has been introduced to give more control. Please check the usage [here](/you-dont-need-the-menu-provider). The `contextMenu` helper
is a game changer.
