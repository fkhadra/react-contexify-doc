# You don't need the MenuProvider

The `MenuProvider` component is fine but most of the time you may need more control. When it happens rely on the
`contextMenu` helper instead.

```js
import { contextMenu } from 'react-contexify';
```

Typical use case, you want to display the menu only for a specific element inside a canvas. 

<Playground code={youDontNeedTheMenuProvider} />
